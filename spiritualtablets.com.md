# The Story In one line:  
Spiritual intellect is the root - Physical  health  is  the  fruit

# Spiritual Tablets Framework (STF)

The pillars of healing in the Spiritual Health Care System lies in integrating the following

1.  Individual ignorance lies at the root of all suffering. Wisdom encapsulated as the Spiritual Tablets helps minimize and eliminate the same.
2.  Quantum Physics defines us as a combination of Energy, Frequency, Information and Matter.
3.  Emotions = Energy in Motion. (Motion involves Frequency)
4.  Lowering of Frequencies is a manifestation of Disease and Discomfort.
5.  We create our own reality through our Thoughts.
6.  It is important to lead a balanced lifestyle aligned to our “Purpose of Life”

Thus health = effective management of the above pillars. As we go through our life phases, we encounter challenges. The spiritual health care system empowers us with wisdom capsules that stitches the above pillars with the power of Meditation to lead a smooth & happy life journey.
