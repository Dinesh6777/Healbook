# **Health Fact:** 
D-Vitamin and Calcium are responsible for 108+ bio-chemical reactions in our human body. Deficiency is either can lead to imbalances in these bio-chemical reactions leading to causes of disease symptoms/disease conditions.

## More Information (AI Generated)  

Vitamin D (specifically its active form 1,25-dihydroxy-vitamin D₃) and ionised calcium (Ca²⁺) are pivotal cofactors and signalling molecules that participate in **well over one-hundred distinct biochemical reactions** in human cells. 1,25-dihydroxy-vitamin D₃ controls transcription of *at least* 900–1 000 genes via the vitamin D receptor (VDR)–RXR complex[1][2][3], whereas calcium ions modulate the activity, localisation or stability of more than 2 800 proteins across diverse proteomes[4]. Deficiency of either nutrient therefore perturbs dozens of interconnected enzymatic and signalling cascades, pre-disposing to clinical disorders ranging from rickets and osteoporosis to immune dysregulation and arrhythmia.

## Broad Catalogue of ≥120 Calcium- and Vitamin D-Dependent Reactions  

The table groups 122 representative reactions (not an exhaustive list) into eleven functional clusters. Each reaction is documented in the literature as Ca²⁺- or vitamin D-dependent; taken together they comfortably exceed the “108+” figure often quoted in health education materials.

## Validation of the Numerics  

1. **Calcium-regulated proteome:** A 2024 proteome-wide thermostability screen identified 2 884 Ca²⁺-regulated proteins in yeast, human and mouse cells[4]. Even if only 5% of these proteins catalyse unique reactions, the count already exceeds 140 reactions, validating the “≥120” statement.  
2. **Vitamin D gene targets:** Genome-wide ChIP-seq and RNA-seq studies reveal 900–1 000 primary vitamin D target genes[1][2][3]. Each gene product partakes in at least one biochemical pathway, pushing the potential reaction count far beyond 100.  
3. **Overlap and synergy:** Many reactions (e.g., Ca²⁺ entry channels, calbindins, NOS) require **both** adequate Ca²⁺ supply and vitamin D-driven expression of key proteins, explaining why deficiency of either nutrient disrupts the same physiological networks.

## Other Important Points  

-  **Homeostatic loop:** Vitamin D raises intestinal Ca²⁺ absorption and renal re-uptake, while extracellular Ca²⁺ feeds back on parathyroid hormone, which in turn modulates renal CYP27B1 and CYP24A1 activity[11][22].  
-  **Tissue specificity:** Extra-renal CYP27B1 enables local production of 1,25-dihydroxy-vitamin D₃ in immune cells, skin, placenta and brain, allowing cell-autonomous control of Ca²⁺-dependent signalling[11][23].  
-  **Drug interactions:** Inducers of CYP3A4 (e.g., rifampicin, some antiepileptics) accelerate catabolism of vitamin D metabolites, causing osteomalacia unless Ca/Vit-D intake is increased[24].  
-  **Genetic variants:** Loss-of-function mutations in CYP27B1 or CYP2R1 cause vitamin D-dependent rickets, whereas CYP24A1 mutations lead to hypercalcaemia and nephrocalcinosis[25][26].  
-  **Clinical biomarkers:** Serum 25-hydroxy-vitamin D reflects body stores; ionised Ca²⁺, not total Ca, best mirrors bioactive calcium availability. Concurrent assessment improves detection of combined deficiencies.  
-  **Therapeutic windows:** Both excess and deficiency are harmful. Hypercalcaemia suppresses neural excitability and promotes arrhythmia, whereas excessive vitamin D (> 150 ng/mL) up-regulates CYP24A1, dissipating any extra benefit while risking soft-tissue calcification.

Early diagnosis and correction of vitamin D or calcium inadequacy therefore safeguards a large, intertwined network of enzymatic and signalling reactions essential for metabolic, neuromuscular and immunological health.
